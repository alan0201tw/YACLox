# YACLox

Yet another clox implementation, please refer to Bob Nystrom's [craftinginterpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/).

# Notes

Unlike CPP_LOX, my C++ version of jlox interpreter, which is implemented in a different language than the one in the book, this virtual machine version of Lox implementation will probably have the exact same code as the original one.

I am really not that of an expert to add extra features or something, what I can do is provide my perspective on stuffs during the time I learn this, and maybe add some friendly comments in the code along the way.
